Create a blog website where users can read articles about books, movies, series, anime, and games.
Each article has:

a main cover image,

a text description,

a section with similar recommendations (with poster and description),

a spoiler section hidden behind a button with a warning.
The site must support pagination (12 articles per page).
We will use PostgreSQL on Railway for storage and add an admin panel for article management.
